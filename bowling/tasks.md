## Lowball


### Goals:

* Practice drawing class diagrams as an aid towards understanding existing code

* Practice drawing sequence diagrams as a way to expore potential designs

* Start insisting that conditional complexity be isolated in *Factories*


### Task:

* Implement LOWBALL.

* See bowling/lib/bowling.rb for a description of the Lowball requirements, and a preliminary design discussion.

* Draw a class diagram of the existing code, and at least one sequence diagram of your tentative design.

* Once your goup has a clear, common visual image of what you'd like to achieve, have at it -- write some code.

See branch bowling_4_lowball_refactor for the step-by-step example.

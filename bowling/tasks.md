## Bowling Kata


### Goals:

* Become familiar with the Bowling Problem
* Practice TDD
* Remind yourself of Shameless Green


### Task:

In this task you'll work on the bowling kata exercise (as defined by Robert Martin in bowling/BowlingGameKata.pdf).

Use TDD. The tests are already written, and are in bowling/test/bowling_test.rb.

Run the tests by

    > cd root_directory_of_repo 

and then

    > ruby bowling/test/bowling_test.rb

  or  

    > rerun -x ruby bowling/test/bowling_test.rb


### Details:

The bowling_test.rb contains *10* tests.  The first 5 are duplicates of Bob Martin's.  The next 5 are our own additions.

Your job is to write code to make the tests pass.  Do _as little design as possible_; shoot for shameless green.

Don't be alarmed if you don't get every test to passing in the time given, just concentrate on restraining yourself from doing a bunch of up-front design.

 See branch bowling_l1_tenpin_refactor for a step-by-step example.
